# Walmart Challenge

## Architecture Case
The architecture designed for this case can be found in the "architecture case" folder. This Architecture was designed using Open Source technologies.

for this case the following assumptions were made:

### Assumptions
*	The legacy historical data from the EPL system is inside the organization environment.
* The legacy historical data is generated by a legacy process and this process is going to be running in the implementation of this architecture.
*	The output of the data process is not going to be inserted in the legacy historical data to avoid duplicate records and schema changes.


## ETL Job
The code for this problem can be found in the "com_walmart_reportservice" folder. There is a README in that folder in which explains how to test, run and deployment in diferent environments.
The reports generated in this job can be viewed in the console output or in the output path of the service(configurated in the input contract).

**Note**
In the "reports" folder can be found the reports in csv format to simplify the reading. This output was generated by an previous execution of the job.
